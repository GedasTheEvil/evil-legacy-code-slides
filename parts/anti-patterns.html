        <h3>The almighty method/function</h3>
        <p>How and why people can write 500+ lines-long method is hard to understand.
            Some are thousands of lines long.
            Problems created:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hard to understand</li>
            <li>Untestable</li>
            <li>Usually cannot be reused</li>
            <li>Obviously try to do more than they should</li>
            <li>Take a huge amount of time to fix/refactor</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Copy/Paste/Mutate</h3>
        <p>Instead of separating code into reusable classes or components, code was copied and pasted.</p>
        <p>Over the time the copy-pasted parts have been changed differently,
            and became different mutations of the same code.</p>

        <h3>Bonus: Hungarian notation (variable types)</h3>
        <p>While it seemed like a good idea to have have types defined in languages that did not use them,
            <code>$blSuccess</code> is no better than <code>$success</code> </p>
        <p>It just makes pronouncing the variable names harder.</p>
        <p> You can always have the method argument types in PHPDoc.</p>
        <p>And when the method body is not large, the types would be obvious anyway</p>

        <h3>Bonus: Weird "optimizations"</h3>
        <p>For example, instead of using a simple <strong>foreach</strong>, coming up with something like this</p>
        <pre>
            <code class="hljs" data-trim contenteditable>
                reset($list);
                while (list($key, $item) = each($list)) {
            </code>
        </pre>
